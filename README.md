# Fitness Trainer Website

# Project Summary
This project is a professional and responsive website designed for a fitness trainer to showcase services, build credibility, and attract potential clients. The website features a modern design and is structured into three main pages:

- Landing Page: Highlights the programs offered, services, testimonials, and customer transformation.
- About Us: Includes the trainerâ€™s name, mission, vision, certifications, and training philosophy.
- Contact Page: Features a contact form, social media links, and a Google Map embed showing the trainer's location.

The primary goal is to provide an engaging and informative platform that converts visitors into clients through clear calls-to-action and visually appealing design.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Choices

### Wireframe
The initial layout was designed using Figma for quick prototyping. The layout emphasizes simplicity and a clean user journey, with sections clearly separated by visual hierarchy and white space.

### Logo
A minimalist dumbbell-themed logo was created to represent strength and simplicity, aligning with the trainer's brand.

### Color Scheme
The color palette includes:
    - Primary Color: #E3E6E8 (Light Gray) â€“ Brings a sense of professionalism and calm, ensuring clarity and contrast across the site.
    - Secondary Color: #E63946 (Vibrant Red) â€“ A bold accent color used strategically for call-to-action elements, drawing attention where it matters most.
    - Background Color: #1C1C1C (Deep Black) â€“ Creates a sleek, modern aesthetic while reducing visual strain and enhancing content focus.
    - Typography: Clean, sans-serif fonts like Poppins and Open Sans are used for a contemporary, highly readable look across devices.

- Tweaked button styles and rounded corners
